## Overview

This repo is an attempt to get the FFIEC call reports in usuable order.  At this point each schedule of bulk call reports are read into both a SQLite database, and saved separately as .rds files.  Queries are created to pull time series items from the .rds files.

This repo is a heavy work in progress.  Quireies will be documented if/when the code it is more usable.
