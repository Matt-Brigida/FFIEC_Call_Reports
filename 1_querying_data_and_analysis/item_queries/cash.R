## Getting cash balance from balance sheet ----

## Cash are in codes RCON0071 and RCON0081
## ^^ check to be sure for some banks it is not under RCFD0071 and RCFD0081.  If so we have to query all.  Will just query all to be sure :)

## All codes are from schedule RC, the balance sheet.

### putting this query in the balance sheet query file (see /analysis/...[stuff].../get_panel_data)
### Also this data is a part of the current assets query; maybe just use that query
